# 🛠️ RAGForge

**RAGForge** is a production-oriented **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** backend platform built step by step with real software engineering practices.

The project starts from a clean FastAPI backend and progressively evolves toward document ingestion, project-based storage, metadata management, text extraction, chunking, LLM integration, vector databases, embeddings, indexing, vector search, RAG answer generation, background workers, observability, and production deployment.

RAGForge is not a notebook demo. It is designed as a long-term AI engineering project focused on building a clean, scalable, and professional backend architecture.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

RAGForge aims to become a modular foundation for building production-ready RAG systems.

The objective is to master the full engineering path from a basic backend service to a production-ready AI platform that can later be reused by applications, websites, internal tools, or agent systems as a reliable knowledge backend.

RAGForge is also designed as one infrastructure brick inside a broader agentic systems architecture. It is not limited to naive RAG. It prepares the foundation for retrieval tools, agent tools, orchestration layers, observability, and future AI system components.

---

## 🧠 Knowledge-Oriented RAG Direction

RAGForge is built with the understanding that **RAG is not dead**.

What is becoming obsolete is **naive RAG**: systems that only split documents into chunks, retrieve a few similar passages, and pass them directly to an LLM without strong metadata, structure, provenance, indexing, or workflow control.

RAGForge follows a more modern **knowledge-oriented RAG direction**.

The goal is to evolve from simple document retrieval toward a production-grade knowledge backend where every source is tracked as an asset, every extracted chunk is linked to its origin, metadata is persisted, vectors are indexed, and future retrieval can support grounded answers, citations, semantic search, and agent-ready knowledge access.

The architectural direction is:

```text
Project
  ↓
Asset
  ↓
DataChunk
  ↓
Embedding
  ↓
Vector Indexing
  ↓
Semantic Search
  ↓
Grounded / Augmented Answer
```

This makes RAGForge more than a basic RAG demo. It is designed as a foundation for structured knowledge systems that can later support applications, websites, internal tools, and agentic AI workflows.

## 🚦 Current Development Focus

### Current Milestone

Milestone 5 — RAG Core: LLM, Vector Store & Retrieval

### Latest Completed Branch

Branch 16 — Embeddings & Indexing Foundation

Git branch:

```text
feature/16-embeddings-indexing
```

Branch 16 introduces the indexing foundation that connects persisted MongoDB chunks to the vector database layer.

It adds:

- embedding provider enum
- embedding request and response schemas
- embedding exceptions
- base embedding provider interface
- fake embedding provider
- OpenAI-compatible embedding provider
- embedding provider factory
- indexing request and response schemas
- indexing route
- indexing service
- ChunkStore indexing methods
- VectorDBService provider-neutral cleanup
- vector DB factory no-hardcode cleanup
- LLM factory no-hardcode cleanup
- validation script for indexing
- embedding provider tests
- indexing schema tests

Branch 16 validates the following pipeline:

```text
MongoDB DataChunk
  ↓
EmbeddingProviderFactory
  ↓
EmbeddingProvider
  ↓
VectorRecord
  ↓
VectorDBService
  ↓
VectorDBProviderFactory
  ↓
QdrantProvider
  ↓
Qdrant collection
```

Branch 16 uses a fake embedding provider by default for local validation and testing. The OpenAI-compatible embedding provider is also implemented and ready for real embedding APIs through configuration.

Branch 16 does not introduce semantic search, user query embedding, grounded answers, reranking, hybrid retrieval, full late chunking, or agents.

### Next Branch

Branch 17 — Semantic Search

Branch 17 will connect:

```text
User query
  ↓
Query embedding
  ↓
Vector similarity search
  ↓
Ranked evidence chunks
```

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

RAGForge follows a production-oriented FastAPI `src/` architecture with a service-based backend structure.

The stable architecture principle is:

```text
Route → Service → Infrastructure
```

More specifically:

```text
HTTP Request
    ↓
FastAPI Route
    ↓
Service Layer
    ↓
Storage / Database / Vector Database / LLM / Embedding Provider
    ↓
API Response
```

After Branch 13, the document processing flow follows this cleaner structure:

```text
documents.py
  ↓
PipelineService
  ↓
DocumentProcessingService
  ↓
ProjectStore / AssetStore / ChunkStore
  ↓
MongoDB
```

After Branch 14 and Branch 15, the RAG Core foundation adds provider-based AI infrastructure:

```text
Application / Route Layer
  ↓
Service Layer
  ├── LLMService
  └── VectorDBService
      ↓
Provider Factories
  ├── LLMProviderFactory
  └── VectorDBProviderFactory
      ↓
Provider Interfaces
  ├── BaseLLMProvider
  └── BaseVectorDBProvider
      ↓
Provider Implementations
  ├── FakeLLMProvider
  ├── OpenAICompatibleLLMProvider
  └── QdrantProvider
```

After Branch 16, the indexing foundation adds the embedding and indexing path:

```text
Indexing Route
  ↓
IndexingService
  ↓
ProjectStore / ChunkStore
  ↓
EmbeddingProviderFactory
  ↓
EmbeddingProvider
  ↓
VectorDBService
  ↓
VectorDBProviderFactory
  ↓
Vector DB Provider
```

The route stays thin. The orchestration lives in the service layer. Provider-specific implementation details stay behind interfaces.

[`docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md`](docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md)

---

## 🧩 No-Hardcode Architecture Rule

RAGForge follows a strict configuration rule:

```text
.env
  ↓
core/config.py
  ↓
settings
  ↓
factory/service
  ↓
provider
```

Runtime operational values must not be hidden inside services, routes, or provider factories.

Allowed places for defaults:

```text
.env.example
src/ragforge/core/config.py
tests
validation scripts
documentation
```

Not allowed:

```text
services
routes
provider factories
provider-neutral orchestration code
```

Examples of values that must come from configuration:

```text
embedding model
embedding provider
vector collection name
vector size
distance metric
provider URL
provider name
LLM model
temperature
timeouts
token limits
```

Generic services must not reference provider-specific configuration names such as `QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME`, `QDRANT_VECTOR_SIZE`, or `QDRANT_DISTANCE`.

Provider-specific settings are allowed only at provider boundaries, such as the provider factory and provider implementation.

This keeps RAGForge provider-neutral, testable, and ready for future backends such as Qdrant, pgvector, Weaviate, Milvus, Pinecone, or another vector database.

## 🌿 Development Workflow

RAGForge follows a professional GitHub workflow:

```text
Milestone → Issue → Branch → Pull Request → Merge
```

Each branch should focus on one clear responsibility.

Branch numbering is global across the project.

Examples:

```text
Branch 9  → Docker MongoDB Motor Infrastructure
Branch 10 → Asset Metadata Schemes & Stores
Branch 11 → MongoDB Metadata Indexes & Auth
Branch 12 → Upload and Processing Metadata Persistence
Branch 13 → Data Pipeline Enhancements
Branch 14 → LLM Factory
Branch 15 → Vector DB Factory with Qdrant
Branch 16 → Embeddings & Indexing Foundation
```

Documentation rule:

```text
README.md
= stable public landing page

docs/architecture/
= stable architecture

docs/milestones/
= milestone and branch implementation history

docs/api/
= endpoint details

docs/setup/
= setup and run instructions
```

The README should stay stable.

Branch-specific implementation details should be added to the relevant branch `.md` file.

---

## 🧠 Engineering Principles

RAGForge follows these principles:

- keep routes thin
- move business logic to services
- centralize configuration in `core/config.py`
- use controlled response signals
- use provider interfaces for replaceable external systems
- avoid hidden hardcoded operational values in services and factories
- keep generic services provider-neutral
- keep provider-specific settings at provider boundaries
- keep runtime data outside source code
- keep uploaded files out of Git
- do not commit private `.env` files
- do not expose internal absolute paths
- keep each branch focused on one responsibility
- use one branch identifier everywhere: Git branch, issue, PR, and documentation
- document implementation details in milestone branch files
- treat metadata as a first-class part of modern RAG architecture
- link every chunk to its source asset for traceability and future citations
- keep pipeline orchestration reusable for future workers and agentic layers

---

## ✅ Current Stable Backend Capability

At the end of Branch 16, RAGForge can:

```text
Upload document
  ↓
Persist project and asset metadata
  ↓
Process one asset or all project assets
  ↓
Extract and split document content
  ↓
Persist DataChunk records
  ↓
Update asset processing status
  ↓
Generate embeddings for stored chunks
  ↓
Index vectors into Qdrant
  ↓
Mark chunks as embedded
  ↓
Return a structured indexing report
```

RAGForge also has:

```text
LLM provider layer
  ↓
Fake and OpenAI-compatible providers
  ↓
LLM service
  ↓
LLM generation endpoint
```

And:

```text
VectorDBService
  ↓
VectorDBProviderFactory
  ↓
BaseVectorDBProvider
  ↓
QdrantProvider
  ↓
Qdrant Docker service
```

And now:

```text
EmbeddingProviderFactory
  ↓
BaseEmbeddingProvider
  ↓
FakeEmbeddingProvider / OpenAICompatibleEmbeddingProvider
  ↓
IndexingService
  ↓
Qdrant vector indexing
```

Branch 16 validates:

- document upload,
- document processing,
- chunk persistence,
- embedding generation with fake provider,
- vector indexing into Qdrant,
- chunk embedded status update,
- provider-neutral service architecture,
- no hidden `getattr(settings, ...)` fallback in providers/services/routes,
- no Qdrant-specific configuration leakage into services/routes.

Supported `/process/{project_id}` modes from the ingestion pipeline:

```text
all_project_file_assets
single_asset_by_id
single_asset_by_filename
```

This prepares RAGForge for Branch 17, where user queries will be embedded and searched against indexed Qdrant vectors.

---

## ✅ Branch 16 Validation Result

```text
11 passed
Branch 16 indexing validation passed
```

Architecture audit:

```text
No Qdrant-specific config leakage in services/routes.
No hidden settings fallback in providers/services/routes.
```
